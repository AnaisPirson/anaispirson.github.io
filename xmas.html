            ’Tis Christmas Eve and Waldo is on a quest, <br />
            To find his friends and give them the best. <br />
            Christmas gifts, wrapped up with care, <br />
            Hidden in his pockets with love to share. <br />
    
            There lies the issue, you see? Try as he might, none of his friends are
            in sight. <br />
            He’s peered in windows, rang every bell. <br />
            But still, his friends are nowhere to dwell.<br />
            He’s started to wonder if he’s been naughty or nice. <br />
            Has he done something to make them think twice? <br />
    
            But we can’t let Waldo spend Christmas all alone! <br />
            So help locate Waldo and his 3 friends on the roam. <br />
            <!-- Hidden in the scene, they’re scattered about, <br />
            Waldo, Wizard, and Odlaw—find them, no doubt. <br />
            Once all three are found, the quest will conclude, <br />
            And the combination to the lock will be revealed to you.<br /> -->


            As a thank you, Waldo will give you a gift <br />
            A small token of appreciation, with a lift. <br />
            <br />

            Waldo will give you a gift created with care. <br />
            But before you can claim it, there’s one final key: <br />

            <br />
    
            So let us all take a lesson from this tale, <br />

            You too can find your way, back to the ones you love, <br />
            Just like Waldo, on this special Christmas, above. <br />
